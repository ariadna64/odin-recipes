<h2>Description</h2>
    
<p>This healthy meatloaf recipe is a simplified version of a family favorite.</p>

<h2>Ingredients</h2>

<ul>
    <li>cooking spray</li>
    <li>1 tablespoon olive oil</li>
    <li>1 green bell pepper, diced</li>
    <li>½ cup diced sweet onion</li>
    <li>½ teaspoon minced garlic</li>
    <li>1 pound extra-lean (95%) ground beef</li>
    <li>1 cup whole wheat bread crumbs</li>
    <li>¾ cup shredded carrot</1i>
    <li>¾ cup shredded zucchini</li>
    <li>2 large eggs</li>
    <li>salt and ground black pepper to taste</li>
    <li>¼ cup ketchup, or to taste</li>

</ul>

<h2>Steps</h2>

<ol>
    <li>Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). 
        Coat a 9x5-inch loaf pan with cooking spray.</li>
<br>
    <li>Heat olive oil in a large skillet over medium heat; cook and stir bell pepper and onion 
        in hot oil until onion is translucent and bell pepper is softened, 5 to 10 minutes. 
        Add garlic and cook until fragrant, 1 to 2 minutes. Remove the skillet from heat.</li>
<br>
    <li>Combine ground beef, bread crumbs, carrot, zucchini, eggs, salt, pepper, and bell 
        pepper mixture in a large bowl; mix well using your hands. Press mixture into the 
        prepared loaf pan.</li>        
<br>
    <li>Bake in the preheated oven until no longer pink in the center, 35 to 40 minutes. 
        An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read at least 160 degrees F 
        (70 degrees C). Spread ketchup over meatloaf and continue baking until bubbling, 
        about 5 minutes more.</li>
</ol>
